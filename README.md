## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

This was actually my first project with tailwindcss. I got to learn about tailwindcss. it seems more flexible than bootstrap and __i'm loving it__.
and im looking forward to using it in many of my project. 

### Continued development

I'll continue using tailwindcss until it becomes part of me that ill no longer refer to the __docs__ again.
